        <p>
          • We provide help for people who don’t know much (or anything) about laptops and have no idea whom to ask
          about their worries.<br><br>

          • We help you understand your laptop better — performance, health, issues, and what to do next.<br><br>

          • We guide you toward choosing the laptop you actually need, not the one sellers try to push on you.<br><br>

          • We apologize, but we cannot provide home service. Currently, all help is provided through online voice calls
          only.<br><br>

          • We can assist you in both "Hindi" and "English", so you don’t have to worry about communication.<br><br>

          • You don’t need to pay first. We only ask for payment after we confirm that we can actually help with your
          issue.
